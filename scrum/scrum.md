# Introduction to Scrum

## Scrum Process
- Owner creates Product Backlog
- Team defines wich backlog items are done in the sprint
- tema and stakeholders inspect results and adjust for the next sprint

## Scrum Pillars
- Transparency
  - emergent process of work visible to those performing the work and those receiving the work
  - important decisions based on percived state of the 3 pillars/artifacts
  - enables inspection
- Inspection
  - artifacts and progress towaerd agreed goals to be inspected frequently and diligently
    - In order to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems
- Adaption
  - if aspects of process outcide acceptable limits, or if resulting product is unaccaptable: the process or artifact have to be adjusted
  - Adjustments as soon as possible/as soon as learning anything through inspection
  - more difficult if people involved are not empowered or self-managing

## Scrum Values
Five values Scrum depends on: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage. Team members learn and explore these values as they are working with Scrum events and artifacts.
- Commitment: Team commits to achieving its goals and supporting each other
- Focus: Primary focus on best possible progress on goals
- Openness: Team and stakeholders open about the work and the challenges
- Respect: Team members respect each other to be capable, independent
- Courage: members have courage to do the right thing
  
## Scrum Theory and directions
- Focus on Empiricism and lean thinking
  - Empiricism: assert that knowledge coms from experiance, thus make desicions based on what is observed
  - Lean thinking: Focus on essentials

## Scrum Team
- no sub-teams or hierarchies. Cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal
- self-managing: internally decide who doeas what, when, and how.
- cross-functional: members combined, have all the skills necessary to create value each sprint.
- small enough to remain swift, large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. Typically less then 10 members
- Responsible for all product-related activities
  - Stakeholder collaboration
  - verification
  - maintenance
  - operation
  - experimentation
  - research
  - development
  - anythin grequired
### Roles
- Developers

## Scrum Events
- Sprint is container for all other events
- Each event is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts
- Events designed to enable the transparency
- create regularity and minimize meetings not defined in scrum

### Sprint
- Container for all other events. Each Sprint may be considered a short project
- Fixed length events (mostly 2-4 weeks) to create consistency
  - longer: Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, risk may increase
  - shorter: can be used to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame
- No break between sprints
- During Sprint:
  - No changes are meade that would endanger the Sprint Goal
  - QUality does not decrease
  - Product Backlog is refined as needed
  - Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned
- Enable predictability, by ensuring inspection and adaption of prgess toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month
- Can be canceled by Product Owner, if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete

### Sprint Planning
- Duration 2h * Number of Weeks per Sprint
- Prerequisites
  - Priorized Backlog
  - Groomed & estimated User Stories

  - Planned Capacity
- Output
  - Sprint Goal (Sprint Backlog): Story cards selected for the sprint
    - Including estimation and assignment
    - Clarified for everyone to understand, and filled with information and checklists as required

## Scrum Artifacts
### Product Backlog (Product Goal)
- Long-term objective for the Scrum Team
- Ordered List of tasks
### Sprint Backlog (Sprint Goal)
- Subset of Stories from Backlog with highest priority
- Actionable plan for delivering the Increment

### Definition of Done
- Formal description of state of an Increment, when it meets the quality measures required for the product
  - If a Backlog Item meets the Definition of Done, it is an Increment
- Requirement for release and presentation at Sprint Review
