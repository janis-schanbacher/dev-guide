# Introduction to Scrum

## Scrum Process

- Owner creates Product Backlog
- Team defines wich backlog items are done in the sprint
- tema and stakeholders inspect results and adjust for the next sprint

## Scrum Pillars

- Transparency
  - emergent process of work visible to those performing the work and those receiving the work
  - important decisions based on percived state of the 3 pillars/artifacts
  - enables inspection
- Inspection
  - artifacts and progress towaerd agreed goals to be inspected frequently and diligently
    - In order to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems
- Adaption
  - if aspects of process outcide acceptable limits, or if resulting product is unaccaptable: the process or artifact have to be adjusted
  - Adjustments as soon as possible/as soon as learning anything through inspection
  - more difficult if people involved are not empowered or self-managing

## Scrum Values

Five values Scrum depends on: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage. Team members learn and explore these values as they are working with Scrum events and artifacts.
- Commitment: Team commits to achieving its goals and supporting each other
- Focus: Primary focus on best possible progress on goals
- Openness: Team and stakeholders open about the work and the challenges
- Respect: Team members respect each other to be capable, independent
- Courage: members have courage to do the right thing
  
## Scrum Theory and directions

- Focus on Empiricism and lean thinking
  - Empiricism: assert that knowledge coms from experiance, thus make desicions based on what is observed
  - Lean thinking: Focus on essentials

## Scrum Team
- no sub-teams or hierarchies. Cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal
- self-managing: internally decide who doeas what, when, and how.
- cross-functional: members combined, have all the skills necessary to create value each sprint.
- small enough to remain swift, large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. Typically less then 10 members
- Responsible for all product-related activities
  - Stakeholder collaboration
  - verification
  - maintenance
  - operation
  - experimentation
  - research
  - development
  - anythin grequired

### Roles
- Developers
  - Committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Spring
  - Create a plan for the Spring (Spring Backlog)
  - Instill quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
  - Adapt plan each day toward Spring Goal
  - Hold each other accountable as professionls
- Product Owner
  - maximize value of product resulting from work of the team

    - Ensure Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood
  - May delegate the responsibility of his work, but still remains accountable for it
  - Entire Organizations must respect his decisions for him to succeed. 
    - These are visible in content and ordering of Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review
  - One person, not a committee. May represent needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner
- Scrum Master
  - Coach team members in self-management and cross-functionality
    - by enabling Team to improve their practices within the Scrum Framework
  - Leaders, who serve Team and the larger organization
    - Serve team:
      -  Coach team members in self-management and cross-functionality
      - help Team focus on high-value increments, that meet the Definition of Done
      - Cause removal of impediments to the Teams progress
      - Ensure all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive and timeboxed
    - Serve Procut Owner:
      - Help find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
      - Help Team understand need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
      - Help establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
      - facilitate stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed
    - Organization:
      - Leading, training and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
      - Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization
      - Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work
      - Remove barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams


## Scrum Events
- Sprint is container for all other events
- Each event is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts
- Events designed to enable the transparency
- create regularity and minimize meetings not defined in scrum

### Sprint
- Container for all other events. Each Sprint may be considered a short project
- Fixed length events (mostly 2-4 weeks) to create consistency
  - longer: Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, risk may increase
  - shorter: can be used to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame
- No break between sprints
- During Sprint:
  - No changes are meade that would endanger the Sprint Goal
  - QUality does not decrease
  - Product Backlog is refined as needed
  - Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned
- Enable predictability, by ensuring inspection and adaption of prgess toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month
- Can be canceled by Product Owner, if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete

### Sprint Planning
- Duration 2h * Number of Weeks per Sprint
- Prerequisites
  - Priorized Backlog
  - Groomed & estimated User Stories
  - Definition of Ready 
  - Planned Capacity
- Output
  - Sprint Goal (Sprint Backlog): Story cards selected for the sprint
    - Including estimation and assignment
    - Clarified for everyone to understand, and filled with information and checklists as required

#### Berfore Sprint Planning
- Product Owner: 
  - Groom
  - Prioritization
  - Sprint Goal

  - Team Capacity
  - Schedule Meeting
- Dev Team
  - Individual Capacity
  - Be aware of upcoming Stories

#### During Sprint Planing
- Product Owner

  - Clarify Doubts
  - Order Stories by priority
- Scrum Master
  - Validate Capacity, Recource Allocation
  - Ower assignment
  - Enforce allocation over commitment

### Sprint Review
- Inspect outcome of the Sprint and dtermine future adaptions
- Scrum Team presents results of their work, as well as the progress toward the Product Goal, to key stakeholders 
- Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the sprint and what has changed in their environment.
  - Collaboration on what to do next based on this information. Consequently, the Product Backlog may be adjusted.
    - Consequently its a working session and should not be limited to a presentation.

### Sprint Retrospektive
- Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness
- Team inspects last Sprint with regards to
  - Individuals
  - Interactions
  - Processes
  - Tools
  - Definition of Done
- Inspection of what went well, problems that occured, and how those problems were (or were not) solved, what was learned
- Team identifies most helpful changes to improve effectiveness
  - most impactful improvement are addressed as soon as possible, and might be added to Sprint Backlog
- Concludes the Sprint
- Brainstorm, Presentation and grouping, voting, planning actions
- Coordinate approach: 
  - 5 min: every team member writes Sticky notes in private (with name)
    - About things that went well or bad, wishes, risks,... Can also include feelings.
  - Every team member puts his positions his notes into a coordate system and explains them, as well as the position
    - X-Axis: Time (past, present, future), Y-Axis: Good, neutral, bad
    - Can be a Wall with imaginary Coordinates or a OneNote Document for remote work
  - Upvote cards
  - Talk about the cards, discuss actions to deal with problem and integrate what was learned
- Question based approach
  - What went well; What needs improvement; Ideas; Actions
  - What did you like in the sprint? What's still puzzling you? What didn't work well? What are your improvement ideas?
  - Start; Stop; Continue
    - More on each see: https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/sprint-retrospective/ 
  - In person: Sticky notes to put on whiteboard
  - Remote: 
    - Each member writes cards in private (with name)
    - When presenting each member adds Cards in MS Planner in the List of the question.
      - Alternatively in OneNote in Grid: Appreciations :), Puzzles ?, Risks (Bomb), Whishes (Star)
  - Vote
  - Talk about cards and discuss actions

#### Phasen
1. Recap, worum es geht: das WIE? /  Der Prozess
2. Sammeln von Daten. Fragen: 
  - Was gut/nicht gut in letzten Sprint
  - Was können wir besser machen
  - Wie zufrieden mit Ergebnissen des letzten Sprints
  - Sprint ziele erreicht? Warum?
3. Im Team Clustern und Priorisieren
4. Ursachen finden (Warum existiert Problem/Erfolg/Symptom).
5. Maßnahmen beschließen
   - Am besten sind diese Ziele [SMART](https://kommunalwiki.boell.de/index.php/SMART-Ziele)
  
## Scrum Artifacts
### Product Backlog (Product Goal)
- Long-term objective for the Scrum Team
- Ordered List of tasks
### Sprint Backlog (Sprint Goal)
- Subset of Stories from Backlog with highest priority
- Actionable plan for delivering the Increment

### Definition of Done
- Formal description of state of an Increment, when it meets the quality measures required for the product
  - If a Backlog Item meets the Definition of Done, it is an Increment
