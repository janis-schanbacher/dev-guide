# Story Points (Complexity)
Story Points are a measure to estimate the complexity/velocity relative to other tasks, which helps improve estimations.
- This Abstraction helps estimating, by thinking comparing to other Stories
- Each team member has an estimated number of Story Points per Sprint: Velocity
- Use Fibonacci Sequence for story points 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...
- Use 1 for smallest Tasks

## Velocity
- Amount of work compleated by Team/Team-Members in previous sprints. Used to estimate what can be achieved in future Sprints.
- Used for Sprint Planning under considerations of each members amount of working time in the next Sprint
- First estimation by using average of previous sprints. Therefore first some Sprints need to be done in order to get an accurate velocity estimation
